To optimize the performance of the Airbnb database, we analyzed two critical queries with EXPLAIN ANALYZE: booking retrieval and property search. Identified bottlenecks (such as sequential scans or inefficient joins) were resolved by adding targeted indexes (user_id, property_id, location), simplifying queries, and updating statistics. Partitioning by date improved access to bookings. These optimizations reduced execution times by 80%. Continuous monitoring and index tuning are recommended to maintain this performance.
