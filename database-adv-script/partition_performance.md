"The Booking table was range partitioned on the start_date column, with partitions created for the years 2024, 2025, and 2026. Test queries were run after partitioning was implemented, using EXPLAIN ANALYZE to measure execution time and analyze the execution plan. The EXPLAIN ANALYZE execution plan confirmed that PostgreSQL was only accessing relevant partitions (Booking_2025 for a query on 2025, for example)."
